# msteams — maintainer documentation

> Written against commit `701144dd` (2026-08-13). Everything below was read out of the code at that
> commit; if a reference no longer resolves, treat this page as stale rather than authoritative.

Three files, no overlap:

- **README.md** (this file) — what the plugin is, what it needs, what it exposes, which file owns what.
- **[architecture.md](architecture.md)** — how a message actually travels through the code, and what is persisted.
- **[operations.md](operations.md)** — Azure/Teams setup, config semantics, failure modes, redeploy behaviour.

## What it is

A Microsoft Teams platform adapter built on the **Azure Bot Framework**. Inbound Bot Framework
activities arrive on the daemon webhook `/hooks/msteams/messages`; outbound replies, typing indicators,
card edits and images go out through the **Bot Connector REST API**. It registers itself as an Elowen
`PlatformAdapter` (`plugins/msteams/index.mjs:57`), so a Teams conversation becomes a brain channel
session the same way a Discord channel or a Telegram chat does.

On top of plain chat it provides: a live tool trace edited in place, `AskUserQuestion` rendered as
Adaptive Cards, slash commands with card pickers, per-chat model/reasoning/display overrides, image
round-trips, proactive (host-initiated) pushes, and a downloadable Teams app package.

Since commit `701144dd` it can also **write to a person first** rather than only reply: it builds a
people directory out of traffic it already sees, and `TeamsMessagePerson` opens the 1:1 chat itself.
See "Proactive messaging" below and the detail in [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## What it needs to run

### Credential gate

The plugin registers the app-package API route unconditionally, then requires all three of `appId`,
`appPassword` and `tenantId` before it does anything else (`plugins/msteams/index.mjs:39-45`). With any
of them missing it logs `enabled but appId/appPassword/tenantId are not all configured — not connecting`
and returns: **no platform, no webhook, no tools**. Pinned by
`tests/msteams.test.ts:130` (no platform / no http routes without credentials) and
`:136` (both appear once configured).

### Azure / Teams prerequisites

Summarised here, with the click-path in [operations.md](operations.md):

1. An Entra **app registration** (single tenant) — its Application (client) ID is `appId`, the directory
   ID is `tenantId`, and a client secret is `appPassword`.
2. An **Azure Bot** resource bound to that app id, with the messaging endpoint set to
   `https://<your-domain>/hooks/msteams/messages` and the **Microsoft Teams channel** enabled.
3. The **Teams app package** (downloadable from this plugin — see below) uploaded to the org's Teams app
   catalog so users can install the bot.

Nothing beyond the bot credentials is required for normal chat: the member and roster lookups the plugin
uses for UPN/e-mail resolution are Bot Connector calls, not Graph calls
(`plugins/msteams/lib/connector.mjs:73` for one member, `:78` for the full roster). Microsoft Graph is a
separate, optional layer — see `graphLookup` below.

### Config fields

Declared in `plugins/msteams/elowen-plugin.json:25-53`; Czech and Slovak translations of every label and
hint live in `plugins/msteams/i18n/cs.json` and `sk.json`.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `appId` | string, required | — | Entra Application (client) ID; also the bot id. Used as the JWT audience (`lib/auth.mjs:38`) and to build the bot member id `28:<appId>` (`lib/adapter.mjs:198`, `:652`). |
| `appPassword` | secret, required | — | Client secret for the client-credentials token (`lib/token.mjs:36`). |
| `tenantId` | string, required | — | Tenant-scoped OAuth token endpoint (`lib/token.mjs:25`) and the tenant stamped on a newly opened 1:1 chat (`lib/adapter.mjs:655-656`). |
| `notifyConversationId` | string | empty | Default target for proactive pushes. A conversation id, or a person (e-mail / Entra object ID / display name) whose 1:1 chat the bot opens (`lib/adapter.mjs:764-786`). Empty = pushes are dropped with a warning. |
| `graphLookup` | boolean | `false` | Enables the optional Microsoft Graph layer. Off means **no `GraphClient` is constructed at all** (`lib/adapter.mjs:96`). |
| `graphCatalogAppId` | string | empty | The app's id in the org Teams catalog, needed to install the app for a user (`lib/graph.mjs:80-93`). Only visible when `graphLookup` is on. |
| `respondWithoutMention` | boolean | `true` | When `false`, a non-personal conversation is answered only if the bot is @mentioned (`lib/adapter.mjs:391`). |
| `toolActivity` | enum `off`/`status`/`live` | `status` | What the progress message shows while the agent works. |
| `answerMode` | enum `final`/`live` | `final` | One reply at the end, or the answer streamed into a message. |
| `toolOutput` | enum `hidden`/`summary`/`tail` | `summary` | How much of a finished tool's result the progress message keeps. |
| `toolMessageMode` | enum `single`/`per_tool` | `single` | One edited progress message, or one message per tool call. |
| `runtimeFooter` | boolean | `true` | Appends the `model · context %` line (`lib/format.mjs:27`). |
| `showReasoning` | boolean | `false` | Streams model reasoning into the progress message. Also forces a live stream to exist (`elowen-plugin-shared/display`, `observesLiveEvents`). |
| `language` | enum `en`/`cs`/`sk` | `en` | Language of the bot's **own** service texts (`lib/messages.mjs`). Not the agent's answer language. |
| `historyLimit` | number 0–100 | `0` | How many remembered messages seed a brand-new conversation. `0` means **nothing is written to disk** (`lib/adapter.mjs:236-240`). |
| `visionModel` | model | empty | Model used for turns carrying image attachments (`lib/adapter.mjs:430-432`). |
| `maxImageBytes` | number | `5242880` | Largest inbound image the bot downloads, clamped to 1 MiB–20 MiB (`lib/adapter.mjs:470`). |
| `maxImages` | number 1–10 | `4` | Inbound image attachments sent to the vision model. |
| `maxUploadImages` | number 1–10 | `4` | Generated images attached to one outgoing reply. |
| `askTimeoutMs` | number | `360000` | How long an `AskUserQuestion` card stays answerable, clamped to 30 s–30 min (`lib/adapter.mjs:838`). |
| `rolePolicies` | rolePolicies | — | Sender → allowed projects + role prompt + tool allowlist. First match wins; unmapped senders are ignored (`lib/adapter.mjs:338-343`). |

Three further keys are read by the code but are **not** in `configSchema`, so the settings UI never
offers them:

- `openIdMetadataUrl` (`lib/auth.mjs:16`) and `oauthTokenUrl` (`lib/connector.mjs:16`) — E2E seams used
  by `tests/e2e/msteams/`.
- `agentName` (`lib/adapter.mjs:453`, `:955`, `lib/appPackage.mjs:100`) — see the caveat in
  [operations.md](operations.md#the-agentname-caveat).

## Tools it exposes

Registered in `plugins/msteams/lib/tools.mjs:18` and declared in `elowen-plugin.json:11-20`. Two gates
exist: `adminGate()` requires `ctx.isAdminSession()` (`lib/tools.mjs:19`), `ownerGate()` requires
`ctx.currentIdentity()?.owner === true` (`lib/tools.mjs:20`).

| Tool | Gate | Plan-safe | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TeamsSend` | owner | no | Post into a conversation by id (`lib/tools.mjs:23`). |
| `TeamsMessagePerson` | owner | no | Message a **person** by e-mail / Entra object id / `29:…` id / display name; opens the 1:1 chat if needed (`lib/tools.mjs:42`). |
| `TeamsFindPerson` | admin | yes | Read-only directory lookup; sends nothing. Lists at most 25 matches (`lib/tools.mjs:71`, `:84`). |
| `TeamsChatInfo` | admin | yes | Conversation type, tenant, member count (`lib/tools.mjs:91`). |
| `TeamsMembers` | admin | yes | Fresh roster read, at most 50 listed; also feeds the people directory (`lib/tools.mjs:111`, `:121`). |
| `TeamsMemberInfo` | admin | yes | One member's name / Entra id / UPN (`lib/tools.mjs:127`). |
| `TeamsListConversations` | admin | yes | Conversations on the current service host, paged (`lib/tools.mjs:144`). |
| `TeamsApi` | owner | no | Raw Bot Connector REST: any method + path. Output truncated at 4000 characters (`lib/tools.mjs:165`, `:182`). |

`planSafe` is declared in `elowen-plugin.json:24` and covers exactly the five read-only tools — the
three that write (`TeamsSend`, `TeamsMessagePerson`, `TeamsApi`) are deliberately absent, so plan mode
withholds them. The manifest also sets `"icons": { "Teams*": "💼" }` (`:22`) and
`"showOutput": ["Teams*"]` (`:23`), which makes every tool's output visible in the transcript rather
than hidden by the default policy.

The gating is pinned by tests: `tests/msteams.test.ts:820` (non-operator is refused
`TeamsMessagePerson` and **nothing is sent**), `:828` (`TeamsFindPerson` outside an admin session),
`:834` (operator path succeeds), `:842` (no recipient named → refuses rather than guesses).

## Proactive messaging (since `701144dd`)

The Bot Connector cannot be addressed by e-mail — it only takes a `conversationId`. So the plugin builds
a **people directory** (`lib/directory.mjs`) out of what it already sees: every inbound activity and
every conversation roster carries a `29:` account id, an Entra `aadObjectId`, a display name and (from
the roster) a UPN/e-mail. No extra Microsoft permission is involved. Once a person is known, their 1:1
chat is opened once and remembered.

`graphLookup` is a **second, optional layer** (`lib/graph.mjs`), off by default. It exists only for
people the bot has never met: it resolves an e-mail against the tenant directory and installs the Teams
app for that user so a chat can be opened. It requires the **application** permissions
`User.ReadBasic.All` and `TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForUser.All` with tenant admin consent, plus
`graphCatalogAppId` for the install. What an admin must do, and what happens when they have not done it,
is in [operations.md](operations.md#the-optional-microsoft-graph-layer).

Test `tests/msteams.test.ts:720` asserts that with the switch off **nothing leaves the
process** on an unknown e-mail — the stubbed global `fetch` records zero calls.

## File map

| File | What it owns |
| --- | --- |
| `index.mjs` | Registration: the app-package API route, the credential gate, the `StateStore`, the adapter, the `/hooks` mount and the tools. |
| `elowen-plugin.json` | Manifest: description, `provides`, `icons`, `showOutput`, `planSafe`, the whole `configSchema`. |
| `icon.svg` | The plugin's icon in the Elowen UI. |
| `i18n/cs.json`, `i18n/sk.json` | Czech/Slovak translations of the manifest description and every config label/hint/option. Enforced by `scripts/check-languages.mjs`. |
| `lib/adapter.mjs` | The adapter itself: webhook handling, gating, brain turn, outbound transport, mentions, cards, slash commands, proactive sends. The one large file. |
| `lib/connector.mjs` | Bot Connector REST client: reply/send/update/delete/typing/members/conversations/createConversation/download, with a single 429 retry. |
| `lib/token.mjs` | Entra client-credentials tokens, one cached bearer per scope, refreshed ~60 s before expiry. |
| `lib/auth.mjs` | Inbound JWT verification against Microsoft's JWKS, pinned to our `appId` and the connector issuer, with a `serviceUrl` cross-check. |
| `lib/directory.mjs` | The people directory: remember/list/evict/resolve, persisted under one reserved `StateStore` key. |
| `lib/graph.mjs` | The optional Microsoft Graph layer: e-mail → tenant user, and app installation for that user. |
| `lib/tools.mjs` | The eight `Teams*` tools and their admin/owner gates. |
| `lib/messages.mjs` | The bot's own service texts in `en`/`cs`/`sk`. |
| `lib/cards.mjs` | Adaptive Card builders: the ask card, the paged picker card, the settled one-liner. |
| `lib/stream.mjs` | Teams binding for the shared live-message engine: transport closures, markdown style, image strategy. |
| `lib/format.mjs` | Teams sizing and the runtime-footer markup (`CHUNK = 20000`). |
| `lib/ids.mjs` | Identity helpers: `matchesId`, `senderIds`, `senderIsAdmin`, `displayNameOf`. |
| `lib/appPackage.mjs` | The sideloadable Teams app package: hand-rolled stored ZIP + solid-colour PNG icons + the Teams manifest. |
| `lib/state.mjs` | One line: re-exports the shared `StateStore`. |

`index.mjs:12-15` also re-exports `matchesId`, `senderIds`, `senderIsAdmin`, `displayNameOf`,
`splitContent`, `footerLine`, `CHUNK`, `makeTokenVerifier` and `ConnectorClient` from the plugin entry.
That is the surface the unit tests import (`tests/msteams.test.ts:148`, `:382`) — treat it as
load-bearing rather than incidental.

## Verify it works

From the root of this registry:

```bash
npm run test:ui -- tests/msteams.test.ts   # 54 tests, the behavioural contract
npm run test:e2e:msteams                   # a real published daemon + a fake Bot Framework
```

The E2E scenario (`tests/e2e/msteams/run.mjs`) boots the published `elowen` daemon, installs this plugin
into its data directory the way the marketplace does, drives a signed activity into the real webhook,
checks the async threaded reply and the in-place live-trace edits, and asserts that a garbage JWT
bounces with 401 without ever reaching the brain.

**On a running instance:**

1. The daemon log should carry
   `msteams platform registered (webhook /hooks/msteams/messages + chat tools)` (`index.mjs:59`) and
   then `msteams connected (app <appId>)` (`lib/adapter.mjs:123`). A `msteams credential check failed: …`
   instead means the token call failed but the adapter is still up.
2. `GET /plugins/msteams/app-package` (admin) returns the ZIP; it returns **503** while the plugin is
   enabled but not configured (`index.mjs:28`) — deliberately 503 rather than 404. Any non-empty
   sub-path under that mount is a **404** (`index.mjs:27`).
3. Send the bot a direct message from a mapped sender. You should see a typing indicator, then a reply
   threaded under your message.
4. `/help` in that chat answers with the command list (`lib/adapter.mjs:954`); `/status` reports the
   live model and context.
