/** The markup Teams' runtime footer is wrapped in. Bot messages there have no small-text style at all —
 *  Teams documents only bold, italic, strikethrough, monospace, blockquote and links for text-only
 *  messages, so nothing can actually shrink the type the way Discord's `-#` subtext does. What is left is
 *  weight: a blockquote draws a full-width bordered strip that dwarfs a one-line footer, so the footer is
 *  an em-dash lead-in in italic instead — the same shape the Telegram adapter uses, with no box around it.
 *  The dash follows the opening `*` with no space so Teams cannot read the line as a bullet item.
 *
 *  The leading non-breaking space is what sets the footer a line below the answer. The engine already
 *  joins body and footer with a blank line, but Teams renders that break tight, and markdown drops an
 *  EMPTY paragraph — so the gap has to be a paragraph holding something, and U+00A0 is that something
 *  while still looking blank.
 *  Named and passed like every other surface's fence so the footer itself stays one shared shape. */
