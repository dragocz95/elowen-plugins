// dev-commands plugin: a curated set of opencode-style custom slash commands, contributed to every chat
// surface via ctx.registerCommand. Each command is a prompt macro — invoking `/name <args>` sends its
// prompt to the agent with PI's native argument substitution ($ARGUMENTS / $1..$9). Pure declarative
// content: no tools, no network, no state. Opt-in (not enabled by default); the operator picks which
// commands to expose.

/** The full catalogue. `prompt` supports PI placeholders — `$ARGUMENTS` (everything typed after the
 *  command), `$1..$9` (positionals), `${N:-default}`. */
