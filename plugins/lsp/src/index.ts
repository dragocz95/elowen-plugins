/** lsp — live language-server diagnostics and code intelligence as a plugin.
 *
 *  The whole subsystem moved out of the daemon core: the LSP wire codec (protocol.ts), the per-server
 *  client (client.ts), the server catalog (servers.ts), the npm installer for Elowen's own server
 *  prefix (install.ts), the client pool (manager.ts), the six brain tools (tools.ts) and the
 *  grandfathered `/brain/lsp*` routes (api.ts). Core keeps no LSP code and no import of it.
 *
 *  Why it is optional: LSP spawns real language servers as CHILD PROCESSES. An operator who does not
 *  want tsserver/pyright/gopls running under their daemon turns the plugin off and gets exactly that —
 *  no tools advertised, no routes, no process.
 *
 *  Lifecycle: the manager is created lazily (nothing spawns until the agent checks a file) and owned by
 *  the registered SERVICE. `stop()` disposes every live client, and the host stops services around a
 *  plugin reload/disable — so a config change or a toggle can no longer leave orphaned language servers
 *  behind, which the pre-extraction daemon-wide singleton did (it lived until the process died).

  // Read-through, never constructing: a status poll must not be what brings a language-server manager
