 *  Hex-only by design: these values are interpolated into `git` command lines, and the plain-hex shape
 *  is what guarantees one can never be parsed as a flag/option (`--all`, `-c`) or a pathspec.
 *  Mirrors src/shared/gitSha.ts — a plugin may not import daemon code at runtime, and the label writer
 *  that guards `base:<sha>` lives here now. */
