/** Freeze the per-task change list at close: the files THIS task committed, as `git diff base..HEAD`
 *  in the agent's checkout (`cwd`). `base` is the `base:<sha>` label stamped at spawn; HEAD is read now,
 *  so the snapshot only sees commits this task landed (in PR-native mode Elowen commits each phase before
 *  this runs). No baseline (a hand-closed task) or no commits → empty list, never the live working tree.
 *  Best-effort: a git failure logs and leaves the task without a snapshot rather than blocking the close. */
