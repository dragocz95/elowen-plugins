// The inner NOT EXISTS requires the depended-on task to actually EXIST and be closed/cancelled — a
// dangling edge (its target was deleted, or never existed — the store now rejects new ones, but a
// legacy row may still be sitting in task_deps) must block readiness forever, not read as vacuously
// satisfied. A plain `JOIN tasks dt` would silently drop a dangling edge from consideration instead,
// which is exactly how a typo'd dependency used to let a task start early.
