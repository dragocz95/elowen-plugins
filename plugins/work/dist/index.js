/** work — the task domain as a plugin.
 *
 *  It owns the task tracking vertical: the `tasks` / `task_deps` / `task_usage` tables (ctx.db().migrate
 *  — see store/migrations.ts), the stores over them, and the Elowen* control-plane tools that drive
 *  them. Disable it and an instance genuinely stops tracking work: the tables are not consulted, the
 *  daemon's task routes answer 503, and the tools are not advertised at all.
 *
 *  The domain is published as the `tasks` CONTROL rather than under this plugin's name, so the daemon
 *  and the agents plugin ask for a domain and never for "work" — the missions subsystem is built on
 *  task rows and reaches them through that control (host stores seam), refusing honestly when it is
 *  gone. Construction is LAZY: register() only registers, and the stores are built on first use, which
 *  keeps a sub-agent runner (which loads the plugin but never serves a request) from opening anything.
