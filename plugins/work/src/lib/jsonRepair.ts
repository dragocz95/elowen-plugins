/** Best-effort repair of nearly-valid JSON emitted by a model. Inputs here are already a single
 *  balanced `{...}`/`[...]` snippet (sliced by extractJson), so we only fix *content* malformations
 *  models commonly produce — especially once a user has edited the prompt that asks for JSON and the
 *  model drifts slightly off-contract. The transforms are textual and deterministic; we never invent
 *  structure, so a snippet that is genuinely not JSON still fails to parse afterwards.
 *
 *  Order matters: quotes are normalized to double FIRST, so every later pass (comment stripping,
 *  bare-key quoting, trailing-comma removal) sees correct string boundaries and never edits content
 *  that lives inside a (possibly originally single-quoted) string literal. */
