 *  an elapsed timer, a spinner) so its pane text keeps changing; a wedged or genuinely-idle one goes
 *  static. No timer/keyword parsing, so it works the same for claude-code, codex, opencode, etc.
 *
 *  The signature is `hash + ':' + length`: the length makes the rare 32-bit-hash collision (two
 *  different screens that hash the same) read as "changed" rather than a false "idle". */
