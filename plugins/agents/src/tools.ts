/** The subsystem's brain tools — ElowenListMissions + ElowenListSessions, moved out of the core
 *  Elowen* control plane (src/brain/tools) with byte-identical names, labels, descriptions and
 *  parameter schemas so a prompt cache sees the same tool bytes (only the advertised ORDER changed,
 *  a one-time invalidation the extraction plan accepts).
 *
 *  Two deliberate differences from the core originals:
 *  - They execute IN-PROCESS against the plugin runtime instead of a localhost REST round-trip (the
 *    host's service token is agent-scoped and may not read '/missions'), serving the exact payload the
 *    corresponding GET routes return.
 *  - As plugin tools they are COMPOSED into every session kind (the platform composes plugin tools
 *    everywhere and gates at execute time), where the core built-ins were owner-chat-only by
 *    construction. The execute-time gate below restores that boundary: a channel or task-worker turn
 *    gets a refusal, never the owner's control-plane data.
 *
 *  The gate reads `currentAccess().owner`, NOT isAdminSession(). Owner truth is what the core
 *  built-ins were scoped by, and it is independent from admin project scope: a platform admin (a
 *  Discord moderator) is admin-but-not-owner and stays refused, while the owner's own sub-agents
 *  inherit owner and are admitted — which READ_ONLY_AGENT_TOOLS (src/brain/agents/agentRegistry.ts)
 *  explicitly intends by listing both tools as control-plane reads for explore/plan children. Gating
 *  on isAdminSession() instead advertised two tools to every read-only sub-agent that could only ever
 *  refuse. Tenancy follows the same descriptor, so a project-scoped child sees only its own projects
 *  rather than the operator's whole estate. */
