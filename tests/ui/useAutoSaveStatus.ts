/**
 * Debounced auto-persist with a visible status, stale-response protection, and a flush hook — the
 * Shared race-safe auto-save controller. Runs `save` shortly after any of `deps` change, but never
 * for the seed value; `ready` gates it until the form has been seeded from the server.
 *
 * - `status`: 'idle' | 'saving' | 'saved' | 'error' — render it in the modal footer.
 * - serialized writes: when another edit lands during an in-flight request, exactly one follow-up
 *   write with the latest form state runs after it. This prevents an older request from finishing
 *   last and overwriting a newer value on the server.
 * - `flush()`: run any pending debounced save immediately (call it before closing the modal). It also
 *   runs automatically on unmount, so a change made moments before close is never silently dropped.
 * - `retry()`: re-run the save after a failure.
 *
 * `savable` is the form's VALIDITY, and it is a separate knob from `ready` on purpose: `ready` says the
 * form has been seeded (so the seed value itself is never written back), while `savable` says the current
 * value is worth writing. Folding validity into `ready` looks equivalent and is not — a form that is
 * seeded locally and only becomes valid once the user finishes typing would have its first valid edit
 * consumed as the "seed run" and never persisted. While the form is invalid the save is held (and any
 * pending one cancelled), so the status never claims a save that did not happen.
